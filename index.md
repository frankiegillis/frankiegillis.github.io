I'm a maths undergraduate at the University of St Andrews and 2025 Laidlaw Leadership and Research Scholar.

My 2025 summer research project was in Algebraic Graph Theory, and was related to graph reconstruction.
Here's my [poster](pdfs/Laidlaw_Research_Poster) and [research essay](pdfs/Laidlaw_Research).

For the things I've done, see my [CV](pdfs/CV.pdf) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankie-gillis/).
