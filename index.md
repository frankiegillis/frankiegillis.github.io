I'm a maths undergraduate at the University of St Andrews and 2025 Laidlaw Leadership and Research Scholar.

My 2025 summer research project was in Algebraic Graph Theory, and was related to graph reconstruction.
Here's my [poster](pdfs/Laidlaw_Research_Poster.pdf) and [research essay](pdfs/Laidlaw_Research.pdf).

I also contribute to the Digraphs package for GAP. Here's an explanatory [note](pdfs/Is2EdgeTransitive.pdf) on the function
Is2EdgeTransitive.

For the things I've done, see my [CV](pdfs/CV.pdf) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frankie-gillis/).

Otherwise, take a look at [this](pdfs/Pseudo_Similar_Graph.pdf) amazing graph. The vertices labelled 1, 2, 3, 4 have pairwise-isomorphic
vertex-deleted subgraphs, while at the same time no automorphism of the graph maps one vertex onto another. We call vertices
having this property (mutually) *pseudo-similar*.
